This circuit is a basic bus configuration that generates seven memory reference instructions (AND, ADD, LDA, STA, BUN, BSA, ISZ). You can call the CPU module of this code in your own module and implement various instructions using these seven commands. In this code, the steps of fetch, decode, effective address, and execute are implemented accurately. My effort is to upgrade this code as soon as possible and add register reference and I/O reference instructions.
